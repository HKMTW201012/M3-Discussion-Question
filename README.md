M3 Discussion Question

题目要求：
What would be the design revision if all SOE people have this common attribute yearsOfExperience?
How do you incorporate different people’s duties into the design?
Dean: doManage() and signDoc()
Staffs: doWork()
Faculty: doTeach()
Students: doStudy()
Dean may help a faculty to doTeach() if the number of faculty falls short. He may also doWork() for a staff if more than one staff is on vacation. What revision you may do to the design?
Sometimes, a staff may take over the dean’s doManage() duty if he is out sick. Besides, a staff is allowed to take courses to pursue another degree. What would you do for the design?
When the dean is out sick, certain faculty may signDoc() for him. What would you do for design revision?
Is it possible for staffs not to signDoc() and faculty not to doManage()? What would be your design change?
If Behrend has another school SOB available, how should the design incorporate it? Was the original design good?
What would be your design changes if Behrend occasionally wants to announce job opportunities to all students regardless of their schools?
